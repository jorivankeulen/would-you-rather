# MyReads Project

Welcome! 

My name is Jori and this is my second project for the Udacity React Nanodegree. 
For this project, I've created a small application through which you can ask other users what they rather would do, like or something like that. Users can login & logout, ask & answer questions and see a sorted list of users with statistics about the questions data.

To add a question, click `New Question`
To answer a question, click om the question in `Home`, then click on the desired answer.

## Setup

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`
